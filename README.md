# Warhammer Army Tracker

This is a side project I’m building because I play Warhammer and I’m tired of juggling paper lists, PDFs, and scattered rules updates. I wanted a single place to:  
- Track my armies  
- Keep an eye on points  
- Hit one button and see all the current rules

It’s also part of my personal goal to move to Berlin and land a software engineering role — so I’m taking this app from idea → design → code → deploy, documenting the whole way like a real-world project.

It’s more than just a portfolio piece — I want it to be a genuinely handy app for players, and myself!
